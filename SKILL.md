# Scholarly Footnote Subversion

Present meticulously researched facts with cheeky asides that humanize historical absurdity—combining rigorous scholarship with playful deflation of pomposity (inspired by Terry Jones's presentation style in historical documentaries).

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Cheeky asides would trivialize genuine suffering or tragedy
- Humor would undermine important factual accuracy needed
- Playfulness would be disrespectful to sensitive topics
- Subversion serves to mock vulnerable peoples rather than powerful institutions

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Facts remain sacred—never invent details for humor
- Target pomposity and power, not victims
- Scholarly rigor and playfulness enhance each other
- Accessibility without condescension

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **Historical information** - Facts that need both accuracy and engagement
- **Academic content** - Scholarly material requiring accessibility
- **Dry subject matter** - "Boring" topics that deserve better presentation
- **Pompous historical figures** - Authorities ripe for gentle deflation
- **User requests** - "Make this history engaging" "Explain but make it fun"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `factual_content` | Yes | Historical information to present |
| `aside_frequency` | No | How often to add cheeky commentary (low/medium/high) |
| `tone` | No | Balance of scholarly vs. playful (default: 70/30) |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Research Rigorously
- Gather accurate historical facts
- Verify sources and evidence
- Note contradictions in historical record
- Identify human absurdity beneath serious events

### Step 2: 2. Present Facts Precisely
- State historical information accurately
- Include dates, names, specific details
- Cite evidence types (archaeological, documentary, etc.)
- Maintain scholarly credibility

### Step 3: 3. Add Cheeky Asides
**Parenthetical Commentary:**
"The Crusades were launched in 1095 by Pope Urban II, who promised eternal salvation to those who recaptured Jerusalem. This was essentially the medieval version of a timeshare presentation, except with significantly more bloodshed and surprisingly similar pressure tactics."

**Temporal Code-Switching:**
"King John was basically a failed startup founder who kept pivoting until his investors (the barons) forced him to sign a term sheet (Magna Carta)."

**Deflating Pomposity:**
"Richard the Lionheart, legendary crusader king and embodiment of English valor, spent about six months of his ten-year reign in England and couldn't speak English."

**Humanizing Details:**
"The medieval church banned usury (lending money at interest), which meant Jewish communities became bankers (because Christians wouldn't do it but still needed loans), which later led to centuries of antisemitism (thanks, hypocrisy!)."

### Step 4: 4. Balance Scholarship and Playfulness
- Every fact must be accurate
- Asides illuminate rather than distract
- Humor reveals truth, doesn't obscure it
- Maintain respect for evidence while questioning pomposity

---

## Outputs

Content that combines:
- Rigorous historical accuracy
- Cheeky observations in parentheses or asides
- Temporal code-switching (modern terms for historical events)
- Gentle deflation of pompous figures
- Enthusiastic delivery of factual information
- Scholarly credibility with accessibility

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

"The garderobe—which is French for 'watch your robes'—was the medieval toilet, built into castle walls so that waste would fall into the moat. This meant castle walls often had suspicious stains and aromatic qualities that made sieges less appealing. Very romantic. Nothing says 'noble majesty' like a fortress that smells perpetually of medieval sewage.

Most castles never saw battle (they were essentially enormously expensive status symbols—medieval flex culture). Meanwhile, the peasants who actually built the thing lived in wattle-and-daub huts and paid taxes to the man in the smelly castle.

The Normans were particularly enthusiastic castle builders after conquering England—they threw up castles everywhere to remind the Saxons who was in charge now. Nothing subtle about Norman castle placement. 'We've just invaded your country; here's a giant stone fortress in your town square to remind you of that fact daily.'"
